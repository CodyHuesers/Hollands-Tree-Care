# Hollands-Tree-Care
Website for Tree Care Service 

Website URL: hollandstreecare.com

This was a commissioned project for a local tree care business. 

I used a combination of HTML, CSS, javascript, php, and bootstrap for a lot of the framework (navbar/grid).
It is a simple, responsive, and user-friendly website.
The website is all on one page outside of two parts:
  - Inside the gallery section there is a button that brings you to a new page. This was done to not clutter things and allow the client to add as many photos as they wish. On the gallery page there is a return to home button. 
  - Once the contact feature is used the user is redirected to a thank you page with a return to home button.
